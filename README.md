# Network Obfuscation

This Linux Foundation project focuses on mechanisms to provide in-network network obfuscation techniques that can confuse machine learning techniques at fingerprinting data flows.

## Background

This work follows on previous works such as Dust, Marionette, Taranet, BuFLO, etc.
Traffic, even when encrypted can be fingerprinted and analyzed, violating user privacy.
The purpose of this work is in the use case where multiple entities operate a network or overlay, where any node in the path can passively attempt to fingerprint flows which transit through it.
Multiple methods have been implemented which have varying levels of obfuscation.

## Installation and Usage

Installation and Usage instructions are located in the top-level directory for the desired approach.
